    <p class="w3-large w3-center">Touring is an experience matched by none other, 
	whether it’s a weekend ride out of town or a longer ride to a far-off destination.
	Some of us are solo bikers while some like to ride in a group. And then there are some who don’t mind the added baggage of
	a pillion and believe in truly bonding through the shared experience of riding on the same bike.
	All these experiences are quiet distinct and need very different preparations. 
	Riding is not just about passion, but also about commitment and being smart. Especially when it comes to those long touring trips.
	You won't get too far by just burning gallons of fuel (figuratively speaking!), if you don’t have a few tricks of the trade up your
	sleeve – something that only experience can get you. </p>
